## Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

- Statistical theory that states that the mean of a sample from a population will be close to the population mean if the sample size is large enough
- the distribution of the sample mean will be normal, regardless of the distribution of the population
- Binomial sample with normal distribution

## Given a random generated binomial distribution

```{r CLT, echo = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(1234)

BiNums = data.frame(vals = rbinom(n=1000, size=50, prob=0.5))

```

## A large binomial sample moves toward a normal distribution

```{r CLT plot}
ggplot(BiNums, aes(x=vals)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=after_stat(density)),      
                 binwidth=.5) +
  geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666")  

```
